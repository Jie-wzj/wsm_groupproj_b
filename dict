オープンサイエンスの効果はさまざまに論じられてき 1 13456556
た。たとえば経済協力開発機構（oecd）の報告書 1 13456560
では， 1 13456564
科学研究の効率化，研究の透明性や質の向上，技術革新の 1 13456568
加速，経済への波及効果，地球規模の課題への取り組み， 1 13456572
共同研究の推進などが挙げられている。 1 13456576
折しも 1 13456580
月以降，新型コロナウイルス（2019- 1 13456584
ncov）の感染が中国の武漢市から世界中に拡大して「地 1 13456588

日には世 1 13456596
界保健機関（who）が国際的な緊急事態であると宣言し 1 13456600
。これに対して各国・地域の研究者，助成機関，学術 1 13456604
出版社といったステークホルダーが最新の研究成果の公開 1 13456608
と再利用を進めて対策にあたるという，まさに「オープン 1 13456612
サイエンス」というべき動きが起きている。そこで本稿は 1 13456616
新型コロナウイルスに関する学術界の動向を概観した上 1 13456620

新型冠状病毒肺炎（covid-19）主要通过呼吸道飞沫传播及密切接触传播。肺功能检查可增加医务人员和受检者发生covid-19传播的风险，必须严 1 13457440
格执行有效的预防和控制措施以防止院内感染。为了指导肺功能检查室医务人员做好防控工作，本指引结合肺功能检查的特点，制订了当前疫情下肺功能检查在医务 1 13457444
人员管理、检查流程管理和检查环境物品管理3个方面的要求及注意事项。主要强调在疫情流行期间，必须严格掌握肺功能检查的适应证，强烈建议covid-1 1 13457448
9确诊病例或疑似病例在传染期内暂缓检查，其他病患如非病情急需也暂缓检查；肺功能室医务人员应严格执行标准分级防护措施；受试者应在单独区域进行隔离检 1 13457452
查；检查时必须使用一次性呼吸过滤器；并重视肺功能检查环境和设备的清洁消毒。 1 13457456

随着新型冠状病毒肺炎（covid-19）患者大量出院，部分患者出院后出现再次发热、核酸检测阳性的现象。这可能是由于新型冠状病毒（2019-nco 1 13457480
v）的生物学特性所决定的，也可能与患者的基础疾病、临床状况、糖皮质激素的使用以及标本采样、处理、检测有关，甚至还与部分患者再次感染或继发其他细菌 1 13457484
病毒感染有关。为此，我们建议针对这一现象，应在指南基础上进一步对患者出院进行分层管理，尤其是高龄、有基础疾病或重症及危重型患者可能要进行相应处理 1 13457488
措施，对于患者住院后长期吸氧难以完全脱氧者采用个体化的处理方式和不同出院评估标准，旨在保证彻底治愈患者，防止出院后 1 13457492

引起2002年严重急性呼吸综合征（sars）和2012年中东呼吸综合征（mers）的冠状病毒 1 13458300
被证实是从动物传播至人类的。而2019新型 1 13458304
冠状病毒（2019-ncov）引起了新型冠状病毒肺炎的暴发，则再次证明cov对人类健康具有重大的威胁。2019-ncov除感染呼吸系统外，研究报 1 13458308
道其对心血管系统也有侵害作用。本文对2019-ncov的基因组结构、功能以及感染者的病理生理学和心脏表型特征、心脏损伤的潜在机制、相关治疗策略进 1 13458312
行了梳理，警示临床医生注意2019-ncov对心脏的潜在风险、加强心脏功能管理。 1 13458316
自2019年12月以来，中国湖北省开始出现了2019新型冠状病毒（2019-ncov）感染疫情并逐渐扩散至其他省份乃至其他国家。该病毒具有传播能 1 13458320
力强、临床表现多样、潜伏期长、可隐性传染等特征，对人类生命安全和健康造成严重威胁。随着病例数的不断增加和临床资料的不断丰富，2019-ncov感 1 13458324
染患者除了典型的呼吸系统表现外，与病毒感染相关的心肌损伤情况逐渐受到重视。根据已公布的资料，我们总结了目前已知的2019-ncov感染患者的心肌 1 13458328
损伤表现、特征、对病情及预后的影响，并对可能的损伤机制、治疗方法以及未来的研究方向作一论述。 1 13458332
